## Medicines And Covid related Resources for Everyone => Team CurbYourK-Means
CurbYourK-Means Team Project => A part of the project (Covid 19 dashboard) was the submission at HackDSC 2021, VIT. 
Full Stack/Django Developer => Ajit Singh, BTech. 3rd year, IIITG-ECE
Software Developers => Ashmik Harinkhede, BTech. 3rd year, IIITG-CSE &  Ankit Kumar BTech. 3rd year, IIITG-ECE (Android Application Developer)

Idea => We accumulated the ideas for the project over the course of participating in many hackathons.
Participating and winning *2nd position in SocioThon 2021* convinced us to work in the **healthcare** domain. The Covid-19 Pandemic uprise in India (March 2021- May 2021) convinced us to build a **Covid based application**.
As a result, we created a healthcare application which has Covid-19 dashboard to help the poor and uninformed procure critical Covid-19 related information. 
Also, as a part of social goodwill, we have implemented the Indian Government's **Jan Aushadhi Scheme** so as to prescribe the cheapest medicines available in the market to the people. 
We are using the **YouTube Data API** to help display relevant information about an entered prescription so that the user can gain some awareness.
